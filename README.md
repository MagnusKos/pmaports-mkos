# pmaports-mkos
### Just a fork of PostmarketOS's aports with custom configs.

---
I have some old smartphones and I'd like to tinker 'em a little bit.
PostmarketOS has ports for these phones, but I don't like an idea that I should edit upstreamed APKBUILDs and other project-related files.
So, here is a small submodule repo that should be added to the main `cache_git/pmaports` directory.

### Phones and features
